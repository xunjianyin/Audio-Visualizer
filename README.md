## Features

### ðŸŽµ Audio Sources
- **File Upload**: Load your favorite audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.)
- **Microphone Input**: Real-time visualization of microphone audio
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, stop, and seek through tracks

### ðŸŽ¨ Visualization Modes
- **Bar Spectrum**: Classic frequency bars with gradient colors and glow effects
- **Waveform**: Smooth waveform display showing audio amplitude over time
- **Circular Spectrum**: Radial frequency display for a unique perspective
- **Particles**: Dynamic particle system that reacts to audio intensity

### âœ¨ Visual Effects
- Gradient colors and glow effects
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
- Glass morphism UI with modern styling

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Audio**: Web Audio API (AudioContext, AnalyserNode)
- **Visualization**: HTML5 Canvas 2D
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom gradients and animations
- **Build Tool**: Create React App

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd audio-visualizer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build` folder.

## Usage

1. **Load Audio**: Click "Load Audio File" to select an audio file from your device, or click "Use Microphone" to visualize real-time microphone input.

2. **Choose Visualization**: Select from four different visualization modes:
   - Bar Spectrum for classic frequency bars
   - Waveform for amplitude visualization
   - Circular for radial frequency display
   - Particles for dynamic particle effects

3. **Control Playback**: Use the play/pause/stop controls to manage audio playback. The progress bar shows current position in the track.
